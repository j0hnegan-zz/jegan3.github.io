desc: The VictorOps product page was sorely lacking relevant product info and data indicated high bounce rates and low conversion. I worked with the marketing team to revise the content and sales team to define common pain points they most frequently heard from potential customers.<br /><br />I designed the page using Sketch and Photoshop and built the page using a static site generator.<br /><br />Conversions tripled as a result and engagement rates increased dramatically.
